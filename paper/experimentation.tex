In medecine, \emph{sensitivity} and \emph{specificity} are often used, 
while in information retrieval \emph{precision} and \emph{recall} are preferred.
An important distinction is between metrics that are independent on the prevalence
(how often each category occurs in the population), and metrics that depend on the
prevalence â€“ both types are useful, but they have very different properties.
