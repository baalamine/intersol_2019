\section{Prediction Model}\label{prediction_model}
To learn from labelled patient dataset and be able to properly predict 
the occurence or not of Malaria given a new patient, we harness the logistic 
regression function as our \emph{classifier}. 
In this section, we briefy recall the basic of the logistic regression function
and how it can act as a binary classifier. We start by introducing the binary 
classification problem we have to solve in the study.
